                * About me
                *
                * Hi, I'm Georgina, a student in Master 1 DEV at
                * ECV, currently doing a work-study program at
                * Parker & Parker. My path in web development
                * began 2021 ago with a training course at
                * OpenClassrooms.
                *
                * I've moved between design and development,
                * working for Monkey Monk, Betclic and now
                * Parker & Parker. My path has enabled me to
                * solidify my skills in HTML/CSS, versioning with
                * GitLab/GitHub, and working with frameworks like
                * Bootstrap and Twig.
                *
                * In Mastère 1, I'm venturing into exciting
                * technologies like React and Svelte for Front-End,
                * and Python and PHP for Back-End. My aim is to
                * master these languages and frameworks to improve
                * my development skills.
                *
                * If you're curious to see what I've done,
                * take a look at my GitHub:
                * “https://github.com/GeorginaBerrezel”.
                * Join me on this adventure where every line of
                * code is an opportunity to learn!
            </p>
